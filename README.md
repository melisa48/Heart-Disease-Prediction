# Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data, the model can help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk and improve patient care outcomes.
## Data
The dataset used for this project contains [brief description of the dataset, e.g., "patient records with features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, etc."]. The dataset consists of [number of samples] samples and [number of features] features.
The data can be accessed from [link to the dataset if available].

## Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
- git clone [repository-url]
- cd [repository-name]
2. Install the required libraries:
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
1. To run the heart disease prediction model, execute the following command in your terminal:
- python main.py
2. Replace main.py with the name of your script file if it's different.

## Model Evaluation
The model achieved an accuracy of 75% on the test dataset. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were also calculated to assess the model's performance.
- Accuracy: 75%
- Precision: [insert precision]
- Recall: [insert recall]
- F1-score: [insert F1-score]
These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting heart disease.
